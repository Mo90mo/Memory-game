## Instructions

This is a simple matching game in which the player must match all the 8 pairs of cards in order to end the game.

How to play:
Simply click on the cards to show the front and match them until all the cards' fronts are displayed.

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. The starter project used Bootsrap to build the deck.

What I've done: 

I changed the CSS to add some styling.

I added interactivity using pure Javascript: 
- I created a deck of cards that shuffles every time the page is loaded or refreshed.
- I created functions to display the front of the card, to display match and unmatch cards.
- I created a timer which starts every time the player starts the game.
- I created a moves counter.
- I created a pop up window which appears at the end of the game reporting the total moves and time needed to end the game and asking if the player want to play again.
